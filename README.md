My own CNN implementation. Tested on the FER2013 dataset (facial expression classification)
Network.py is the network implementation. 
main.py is the building/training/testing network for the FER2013 dataset. 
graphics.py is a GUI that classifies emotions of faces in pictures uploaded from pc/taken by the pc camera.
